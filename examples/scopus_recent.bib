	abstract = {Laboratory testing can provide information useful to promote patient health literacy and ultimately patient well-being. The human state of mind involves not only cognition but also emotion and motivation factors when receiving, processing, and acting upon information. The cognitive load for patients acquiring and processing new information is high. Modes of distribution can affect both attention to and receipt of information. Implicit unconscious biases can affect whom and what patients believe. Positive wording and framing of information with salience for patients can evoke positive emotions. Providing patients with the gist, or essential meaning, of information can positively influence decision-making. What laboratorians provide as information helps to combat mis- and disinformation. Laboratorians can actively participate in measures to improve the patient experience in health care by developing and contributing to high-quality information to enable timely, meaningful communication and interpretation of test results. © 2023 The Author},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Multiple sclerosis is one of the diseases of the central nervous system, which causes numerous physical and mental problems. Since stress, anxiety and depression are effective in various dimensions of chronic diseases management and considering that health literacy plays a decisive role in the quality of life of these patients. Therefore, this study was conducted with the aim of determining the association between health literacy and stress, anxiety and depression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current research is a cross-sectional analytical study that was conducted with the participation of 164 patient's from the MS society of Jahrom city with convenience sampling. The data collection tool was the health literacy questionnaire of multiple sclerosis patients and a 21-question stress, anxiety and depression questionnaire. SPSS - 21 software, descriptive statistics and spearman and chi-square tests were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The findings showed that the majority of patients had a borderline health literacy (53.7%). 43.3% of patients had adequate level of health literacy. Also, the findings showed that the stress, anxiety and depression levels of the majority of patients were moderate. Spearman's test showed that there is a negative and significant correlation between health literacy and stress in multiple sclerosis patients (p=0.03) (r=-0.37). While there was no significant correlation between health literacy and anxiety and depression of patients. CONCLUSION: The findings showed that with the increase in the health literacy, the rate of stress in patient's decreases.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adherence to medication adherence plays a vital role in controlling the problems and complications of epilepsy. During the COVID - 19 pandemic and limitations of face-to-face education, the use of distance education can play an important role in providing education to patients. The aim of this study is the effect of model 5A self-management training on medication adherence in epileptic patients. METHODS: In this single-blind randomized controlled trial, 56 epileptic patients referred to Shiraz Namazi Hospital were divided into intervention and control groups using random allocation. Thereafter, 5A self - management training sessions were virtually held in 5 sessions in WhatsApp application for intervention group. The data collection tool was MMAS-8 at two stages of before and two months after intervention. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 21 software. RESULTS: The results of Wilcoxon test showed that in intervention group, the mean drug adherence in patients after intervention significantly increased compared to before intervention (p = 0.005). But in control group, this was not significant (p = 0.909). According to results of Mann-Whitney test, there was no significant difference between intervention and control groups before intervention (p = 0.632). However, by passing two months from intervention, a significant difference was found between intervention and control groups (p = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: Based on results, the implementation of model 5A can be effective on medication adherence in epileptic patients. This program can be considered as a suitable method in epileptic patients during COVID - 19 pandemic.},
