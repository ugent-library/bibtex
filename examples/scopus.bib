	abstract     = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the outcome of Stanford type B aortic dissection in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) and to evaluate aortic diameters at time of dissection as well as the impact of previous aortic root replacement. METHODS: Analysis of all patients with MFS fulfilling Ghent criteria seen at this institution since 1995 until 2022. RESULTS: Thirty-six (19\%) out of 188 patients with MFS suffered from Stanford type B aortic dissection during the study period. The Mean aortic diameter at the time of dissection was 39.0\hspace{0.167em}mm [95\% confidence interval (CI): 35.6-42.3]. The mean pre-dissection diameter (available in 25\% of patients) was 32.1\hspace{0.167em}mm (95\% CI: 28.0-36.3) and the mean expansion was 19\% (95\% CI: 11.9-26.2). There was no correlation between age and diameter at the time of dissection (<20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, <61\hspace{0.167em}years; P\hspace{0.167em}=\hspace{0.167em}0.78). Freedom from intervention after dissection was 53\%, 44\% and 33\% at 1, 5 and 10\hspace{0.167em}years. Aortic growth rate in those patients that had to undergo intervention within the 1st year after dissection was 10.2\hspace{0.167em}mm/year (95\% CI: 4.4-15.9) compared to 5.8\hspace{0.167em}mm/year (95\% CI: 3.3-8.3, P\hspace{0.167em}=\hspace{0.167em}0.109) in those thereafter. The mean time between dissection and intervention was 1.8\hspace{0.167em}years (95\% CI: 0.6-3.0). While type B dissection seems more frequent after previous elective aortic repair (58\% vs 42\%), there was no difference between valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR) compared to Bentall procedures [Hazard ratio (HR) for VSRR 0.78, 95\% CI: 0.31-2.0, P-value\hspace{0.167em}=\hspace{0.167em}0.61]. The mean age of the entire population at the end of follow-up was 42\hspace{0.167em}years (95\% CI: 39.2-44.7). The mean follow-up time was 9\hspace{0.167em}years (95\% CI: 7.8-10.4). CONCLUSIONS: Stanford type B dissection in patients with MFS occurs far below accepted thresholds for intervention. Risk for type B dissection is present throughout lifetime and two-thirds of patients need an intervention after dissection. There is no difference in freedom from type B dissection between a Bentall procedure and a VSRR. \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2023.

	abstract     = {Objectives: Late-onset sepsis is a frequent complication in neonatal intensive care units. This study aims to understand the effect of late-onset sepsis on mortality in hospitalised neonatal patients across different gestational ages. Design: This is a single-centre, historical cohort study including neonates admitted to hospital during a 10-year period (2002 – 2011). Neonates were stratified by gestational age: extremely preterm (<28 weeks), very preterm (28 to 32 weeks), late preterm (33 to 36 weeks), full term (>37 weeks). Setting: Tertiary NICU in Ghent, Belgium. Main Outcome Measures: Logistic regression analysis was used to assess adjusted relationships between late-onset sepsis and mortality, reported as odds ratio (OR) and 95\% confidence interval (CI). Results: A total of 4928 neonates were included, of which 2071 were term (42.0\%), 1425 were late preterm (28.9\%), 1165 very preterm (23.6\%) and 264 were extremely preterm neonates (5.4\%). 40 neonates developed late-onset sepsis (8.2 episodes/1000 patient days). Overall, in-hospital mortality was 5.4\%. Late-onset sepsis was an independent risk factor for mortality in the total cohort (OR = 2.41; 95\% CI = 1.46–3.96). However, when gestational age groups were considered separately, late-onset sepsis was associated with mortality in very preterm neonates (OR = 2.45; 95\% CI = 1.03–5.84) and in the late preterm neonates (OR = 3.92; 95\% CI = 1.41–10.87), but not in other neonates. Comorbidities burdening neonatal hospital survival include acute lung disease, brain damage, periventricular leukomalacia, surgery, and broncho-pulmonary dysplasia. Conclusion: Late-onset sepsis is an independent risk factor for mortality in very preterm and late preterm neonates. Understanding how late-onset sepsis among other factors impact mortality enables a patient and family-centred approach to nursing care including the anticipation of realistic milestones. Implications for clinical practice: Late-onset sepsis is especially detrimental to preterm neonates and this could be taken into consideration by nurses when communicating with families in the perinatal period. \textcopyright{} 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract     = {Background: Accumulating evidence shows a role of the hospital wastewater system in the spread of multidrug-resistant organisms, such as carbapenemase producing Enterobacterales (CPE). Several sequential outbreaks of CPE on the geriatric ward of the Ghent University hospital have led to an outbreak investigation. Focusing on OXA-48 producing Citrobacter freundii, the most prevalent species, we aimed to track clonal relatedness using whole genome sequencing (WGS). By exploring transmission routes we wanted to improve understanding and (re)introduce targeted preventive measures. Methods: Environmental screening (toilet water, sink and shower drains) was performed between 2017 and 2021. A retrospective selection was made of 53 Citrobacter freundii screening isolates (30 patients and 23 environmental samples). DNA from frozen bacterial isolates was extracted and prepped for shotgun WGS. Core genome multilocus sequence typing was performed with an in-house developed scheme using 3,004 loci. Results: The CPE positivity rate of environmental screening samples was 19.0\% (73/385). Highest percentages were found in the shower drain samples (38.2\%) and the toilet water samples (25.0\%). Sink drain samples showed least CPE positivity (3.3\%). The WGS data revealed long-term co-existence of three patient sample derived C. freundii clusters. The biggest cluster (ST22) connects 12 patients and 8 environmental isolates taken between 2018 and 2021 spread across the ward. In an overlapping period, another cluster (ST170) links eight patients and four toilet water isolates connected to the same room. The third C. freundii cluster (ST421) connects two patients hospitalised in the same room but over a period of one and a half year. Additional sampling in 2022 revealed clonal isolates linked to the two largest clusters (ST22, ST170) in the wastewater collection pipes connecting the rooms. Conclusions: Our findings suggest long-term circulation and transmission of carbapenemase producing C. freundii clones in hospital sanitary installations despite surveillance, daily cleaning and intermittent disinfection protocols. We propose a role for the wastewater drainage system in the spread within and between rooms and for the sanitary installations in the indirect transmission via bioaerosol plumes. To tackle this problem, a multidisciplinary approach is necessary including careful design and maintenance of the plumbing system. \textcopyright{} 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract     = {Background: Due to its antioxidant properties, vitamin C might be a promising and effective strategy for preventing postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) after cardiac surgery. This study was aimed at evaluating whether vitamin C supplementation is effective in reducing the cost of in-hospital postoperative medication used for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass (CABG) or valve surgery (\pm{}CABG). Objective: The primary goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of perioperative vitamin C supplementation in patients undergoing cardiac surgery on in-hospital postoperative medication costs, while secondary endpoints were the effects on length of stay (LOS) in both the intensive care unit (ICU) and the hospital, and the incidence of POAF. Material and Methods: From November 2018 to January 2021, 253 patients planned for CABG or valve surgery (\pm{}CABG) in AZ Maria Middelares, Ghent, Belgium, and who met the inclusion criteria (\geq{}18 years of age, all having cardiac sinus rhythm, and who provided written informed consent) were randomised into a placebo group or vitamin C group. The medication was administered orally (1~g twice daily), starting from 5 days preoperatively until 10 days postoperatively. The medication used, LOS in the hospital/ICU, and development of clinically relevant POAF in the ICU were registered. Results: Mean medication costs were \mbox{\texteuro}{}264.6~\pm{}~98.1 for patients in the vitamin C group and \mbox{\texteuro}{}294.9~\pm{}~267.3 for patients in the placebo group. When stratifying according to the type of surgery (CABG or valve surgery [\pm{}CABG]), these costs did not significantly differ. There was no significant difference in LOS or the incidence of clinically relevant POAF. Conclusion: Our data did not identify any short-term financial impact on postoperative medication costs after oral perioperative vitamin C supplementation (1~g twice daily) for patients undergoing a CABG procedure or valve surgery (\pm{}CABG). No effect was found on the LOS or the incidence of clinically relevant POAF. Potential effects in the longer term, after intravenous administration of vitamin C or in other types of (cardiac) surgery, are still to be investigated.

	abstract     = {Background: Parks provide many opportunities for promoting physical, social, and mental wellbeing among older adults and are therefore considered a good setting to promote healthy ageing. However, older adults are the age group least frequently observed visiting parks. To attract more older adults to parks, it is important to understand their needs and preferences for park design. The aim of this qualitative study was to gain in-depth information about older adults' preferred park features for park visitation. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 older adults aged > 60 years who visited a recently renewed urban park in Ghent, Belgium at least once since its renewal. The interviews were conducted in-park or in the nursing home adjacent to the park until saturation of information was obtained. All interviews were transcribed verbatim, pseudonymised, and analysed by inductive content analysis using NVivo 12 software. Results: The most preferred park activities were walking, sitting, and watching the environment. The park features liked by older adults were good quality and accessible walking paths, nature and vegetation, openness and structural layout of the park, and sufficient and good quality sitting areas. The park features that they did not like mostly related to poor park maintenance. Conclusions: This study provides an overview of park features that older adults perceive as important for park visitation. It is the first qualitative study in Belgium to assess which park features entice older adults to visit parks, and it contributes to the limited European knowledge on this topic. The evidence can help urban planners, landscape architects, and policymakers to (re)design attractive local parks that promote healthy ageing. \textcopyright{} 2023 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract     = {Background: The use of antibiotics in mild to severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains controversial. Aim: To explore in-hospital antibiotic use in severe acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD), to analyze determinants of in-hospital antibiotic use, and to investigate its association with hospital length of stay (LOS) and in-hospital mortality. Methods: A retrospective, observational study was conducted in Ghent University Hospital. Severe AECOPD were defined as hospitalizations for AECOPD (ICD-10 J44.0 and J44.1) discharged between 2016 and 2021. Patients with a concomitant diagnosis of pneumonia or `pure' asthma were excluded. An alluvial plot was used to describe antibiotic treatment patterns. Logistic regression analyses identified determinants of in-hospital antibiotic use. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to compare time to discharge alive and time to in-hospital death between antibiotic-treated and non-antibiotic-treated AECOPD patients. Results: In total, 431 AECOPD patients (mean age 70~years, 63\% males) were included. More than two-thirds (68\%) of patients were treated with antibiotics, mainly amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. In multivariable analysis, several patient-related variables (age, body mass index (BMI), cancer), treatment-related variables (maintenance azithromycin, theophylline), clinical variables (sputum volume and body temperature) and laboratory results (C-reactive protein (CRP) levels) were associated with in-hospital antibiotic use independent of sputum purulence, neutrophil counts, inhaled corticosteroids and intensive care unit of which CRP level was the strongest determinant. The median hospital LOS was significantly longer in antibiotic-treated patients (6~days [4–10]) compared to non-antibiotic-treated patients (4~days [2–7]) (p < 0.001, Log rank test). This was indicated by a reduced probability of hospital discharge even after adjustment for age, sputum purulence, BMI, in-hospital systemic corticosteroid use and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (adjusted hazard ratio 0.60; 95\% CI 0.43; 0.84). In-hospital antibiotic use was not significantly associated with in-hospital mortality. Conclusions: In this observational study in a Belgian tertiary hospital, in-hospital antibiotic use among patients with severe AECOPD was determined by the symptom severity of the exacerbation and the underlying COPD severity as recommended by the guidelines, but also by patient-related variables. Moreover, in-hospital antibiotic use was associated with a~longer hospital stay, which may be linked to their disease severity, slower response to treatment~or 'harm' due to antibiotics.

	abstract     = {Importance: The past years, evidence suggested that the primary symptoms traditionally associated with bilateral vestibulopathy (BV) do not represent the full picture of this patient population. Recent literature also demonstrated cognitive impairment. However, although multitasking and dual-tasking are widely present in everyday activities, most of these studies assessed cognitive function only in single-task conditions. Objective: To uncover the association of BV with and without hearing loss with cognitive and motor performance and cognitive-motor interference. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective case-control study assessed persons with an isolated BV and persons with BV and a concomitant hearing loss compared with a healthy control group. Data were analyzed in December 2022. The study was conducted at Ghent University (Ghent, Belgium). Data collection took place between March 26, 2021, and November 29, 2022. Main Outcomes and Measures: All participants completed the 2BALANCE dual-task protocol, comprising a static and a dynamic motor task that was combined with 5 visual cognitive tasks. These cognitive tasks assessed mental rotation, visuospatial memory, working memory, response inhibition (executive function), and processing speed. All cognitive tasks were performed in a single-task condition (while seated) and in a dual-task condition (combined with a static and a dynamic motor task). The static task comprised balancing on a force platform with foam pad, and the dynamic task comprised walking at a self-selected speed on the GAITRite Walkway. Both motor tasks were performed in the single-task and dual-task condition. Results: Nineteen persons with BV and hearing loss (mean [SD] age, 56.70 [10.12] years; 10 women [52.6\%]), 22 persons with an isolated BV (mean [SD] age, 53.66 [13.35] years; 7 women [31.8\%]), and 28 healthy control participants were included (mean [SD] age, 53.73 [12.77] years; 12 women [42.9\%]). Both patient groups had mental rotation and working memory impairment in a single-task condition and slower processing speed when walking (ie, during the dynamic dual-task condition). Additionally, the patient group with hearing loss had impaired visuospatial memory and executive function deficits in single-task and dual-task conditions, while this could only be elicited when performing a motor task in persons with isolated BV (ie, when dual-tasking). Conclusion and Relevance: The findings of this case-control study suggest an association between vestibular function and cognitive and motor performance, even greater in persons with a concomitant hearing loss than in persons with an isolated BV. \textcopyright{} 2023 American Medical Association.

	abstract     = {City street experiments have proven to possess a transitional capacity to achieve system change in urban mobility. Because they challenge the status quo, such experiments often face institutional barriers that can limit their transitional capacity. This paper explores how the role adopted by municipalities–as the formal actor behind institutional arrangements and a key player in urban experimentation–can affect the transitional capacity of street experiments. Using a theoretical framework combining three ideal-typical roles (promoter, enabler and partner) and transitional capacity, we analyze the relationship between the municipality and the Living Streets program in Ghent, Belgium. Our findings reveal that the municipal leadership and subsequent legitimacy accompanied by the promoter and enabler roles can benefit the transitional capacity of experiments in nascent stages, especially when they are radical and potentially contentious. Additionally, the provision of financial, material and human resources, are necessary regardless of role. Lastly, we highlight two dilemmas related to city street experiments and urban mobility: First, should city street experiments be temporarily employed and disbanded once their transitional capacity decreases? And second, can the low-risk nature of experimenting with streets be reconciled with the commitments of long-term policy development required for urban mobility? \textcopyright{} 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract     = {Background: Forelimb extensor tendon rupture (ETR) in foals is sparsely documented. Objectives: To describe clinical and imaging findings, treatment details, and long-term outcome in foals with ETR. Study design: Multicentre retrospective case-series. Methods: Clinical record review of foals with ETR, presented to Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at Ghent University (Belgium), the Clinic for Horses at the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover (Germany), and Rossdales Equine Hospital (UK) between 2009–2021. Long-term outcome based on structured telephone interview with the owner at the university hospitals and on future ratings from a public racing results archive at Rossdales Equine Hospital. Results: Eight foals (28\%; 95\%CI: 11.7\%–44.3\%) presented with ETR only, whereas 21 foals (72\%; 95\%CI: 55.7\%–88.3\%) presented with ETR and concurrent flexural limb deformity foals with ETR only were older (median 20 days; Interquartile range [IQR] 13–22) than foals with ETR and flexural limb deformity (median five days; IQR 3–11; p~= 0.001). Treatment included medical support, immobilization, and box rest. Hospitalisation time was longer for foals with ETR and flexural limb deformity (median 26 days; IQR 16–44) than for ETR-only foals (median 11 days; IQR 6–16; p~= 0.03). Total rehabilitation time was longer for foals with ETR and flexural limb deformity (median 58 days; IQR 42–91) than for foals without flexural limb deformity (median 32 days; IQR 12–39; p~= 0.03). Six foals (21\%; 95\%CI: 6.3\%–35.7\%) were euthanased within seven months: three because of problems with limb protraction and progressive flexural limb deformity. Long-term follow-up (>18 months) was available for two cases with ETR only, and seven cases with ETR and flexural limb deformity. Both ETR-only foals had a positive cosmetic outcome but only one a positive functional outcome. Foals with ETR and concurrent flexural limb deformity suffered limitations regarding cosmetic appearance (5/7 negative) and limb function (7/7 negative). Main limitations: Small sample size, retrospective study, and no clinical follow-up. Conclusions: ETR is a rare condition in this sample of foals treated under hospital conditions often requiring prolonged care, especially with concurrent flexural limb deformity. Further research should investigate potential associations with future athletic performance. \textcopyright{} 2022 EVJ Ltd.},

	abstract     = {A low-threshold methodology for mapping the nocturnal air temperature in an urbanized region based on bicycle measurements and a number of in-situ weather stations is presented. Firstly, two corrections are applied on the bike measurements: a thermal inertia correction to account for the finite reaction speed of the temperature sensor and a temperature decline correction to offset the background temperature evolution during the mobile measurements. The latter includes for the first time land cover information to account for its impact on the nocturnal cooling rate. Secondly, a linear statistical model is used to produce regional maps of the air temperature based on the relationship between the corrected temperature and land cover around the bicycle transect. Applying this methodology on the Belgian cities of Antwerp and Ghent demonstrates that this low-threshold approach allows for a comprehensive picture of the air temperature and that it has advantages compared to more traditional decline corrections. Further improvements could be made by employing more accurate temperature sensors, applying more complex statistical models and performing multiple measurement campaigns per evening. \textcopyright{} 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract     = {Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes differ by geographic location. With the advent of HPV vaccination and HPV-based cervical screening tests in Ethiopia, a nationwide dataset on the genotype distribution of HPV among women has paramount importance in the fight against cervical cancer. However, there is limited data in this regard in the northwest part of the country. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the genotype distribution of high-risk HPVs among women presenting with cervical abnormalities. Methods: A health facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted at Felege Hiwot Comprehensive Specialized Hospital (FHCSH), Bahir Dar–Ethiopia. Women aged \geq{} 30~years who visited the hospital gynecology unit from 01 March 2019 to 30 October 2021 were included. Following general and pelvic examinations, a senior gynecologist collected cervical punch biopsies for histopathological examinations and cervical swabs for HR-HPV detection using the Abbott Alinity m system (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL, USA). Extended genotyping was carried out with the INNO-LiPA HPV Genotyping~Extra~II assay (INNO-LiPA; Fujirebio Europe, Ghent, Belgium) as per the manufacturer protocols at the Institute of Virology, Leipzig University Hospital, Germany. Results: We included 355 women with a mean age of 46.4 \pm{} 11.4~years. The majority of the participants, 277 (79.4\%) were sexually active before the age of 18~years and 180 (51.6\%) had multiple sexual partners. Forty-eight (13.5\%) of the participants were HIV positive. The proportion of HR-HPV was 53.0\% (n = 188; 95\%CI: 47.8–58.1\%). From these samples, 13 different HR-HPV types with a total of 258 sequences were identified. The detection of HR-HPV increased significantly with an increase in the age of the participants. The predominant identified HR-HPV was HPV16, 50.4\% followed by HPV31 (9.7\%), HPV33 (8.5\%), HPV39, and HPV68 each (5.8\%) and HPV18 (4.7\%). Of the total HR-HPV-positive women, 23.9\% (45/188) were infected with multiple HR-HPV types. All HPV16, HPV18, HPV35, and HPV45 genotypes (as a single or in coinfections) were found to be associated with either high-grade lesions or cervical cancer. Conclusions: HR-HPV infection was reportedly higher among women in the present study area. Based on our findings, we strongly recommend the nonavalent HPV vaccine for immunization and any HPV-based screening method to take into consideration the predominant genotypes circulating in the country. The role of multiple HPV infections in high-grade cervical lesions entails further study in Ethiopia. \textcopyright{} 2023, The Author(s).},

On the basis of fieldwork, we explore the potential of public signs as a resourceful strategy for communicating solidarity and support and the discursive construction of a community affected by this crisis. We show that in times of lockdown and social distancing, the residential linguistic landscape in both neighbourhoods became strategically appropriated by local inhabitants to communicate with neighbours and strangers and was operationalised as a vehicle to serve new communicative functions such as the conveying of solidarity and support as well as gratitude, and collective belonging. Some differences related to emplacement, language use and quantity of signs were also observed. Overall, the article documents the affective appropriation of space through Covid-19 signs during the Covid-19 outbreak and periods of lockdown in Flanders, Belgium. \textcopyright{} 2023 John Benjamins Publishing Company.},

	abstract     = {Purpose: Post-operative complications following emergency abdominal surgery are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite the knowledge of prognostic factors associated with poor surgical outcomes; few have described risks of poor outcomes based on admission information in acute surgical setting. We aimed to derive a simple, point-of-care risk scale that predicts adults with increased risk of poor outcomes. Methods: We used data from an international multi-centre prospective cohort study. The effect of characteristics; age, hypoalbuminaemia, anaemia, renal insufficiency and polypharmacy on 90-day mortality was examined using fully adjusted multivariable models. For our secondary outcome we aimed to test whether these characteristics could be combined to predict poor outcomes in adults undergoing emergency general surgery. Subsequently, the impact of incremental increase in derived SHARP score on outcomes was assessed. Results: The cohort consisted of 419 adult patients between the ages of 16–94 years (median 52; IQR(39) consecutively admitted to five emergency general surgical units across the United Kingdom and one in Ghent, Belgium. In fully adjusted models the aforementioned characteristics; were associated with 90-day mortality. SHARP score was associated with higher odds of mortality in adults who underwent emergency general surgery, with a SHARP score of five also being associated with an increased length of hospital stay. Conclusions: SHARP risk score is a simple prognostic tool, using point-of-care information to predict poor outcomes in patients undergoing emergency general surgery. This information may be used to improve management plans and aid clinicians in delivering more person-centred care. Further validation studies are required to prove its utility. \textcopyright{} 2023 Asian Surgical Association and Taiwan Robotic Surgery Association},

	abstract     = {Recent advancements in energy systems, such as the emergence of prosumers and sector coupling approaches, introduce additional flexibilities over multiple energy sectors, such as heating, electricity, and mobility. Due to the complexity of such distributed systems, the optimization of energy allocation is a~non-trivial task, especially considering constraints and limitations introduced by distributed devices or sub-systems. Additionally, the variety of devices forces approaches to be highly situational and not universally applicable. In this paper, a~two-level optimization scheme is proposed, which aims at reducing the optimization complexity of sector-coupled systems. The multi-vector optimization embedded in the two-level optimization scheme is formulated as a~mixed-integer linear problem, optimizing the energy flow between domains, which are modeled as an abstraction of a~sector. Distributed devices are modeled as components that represent an abstraction of devices connected to an energy domain. The optimization process is evaluated based on the data from a~residential complex in Ghent, Belgium. It shows that the approach is capable of minimizing costs, CO 2 emissions, and dependency on external resources. \textcopyright{} 2023, The Author(s).},
