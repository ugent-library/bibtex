    abstract = {The science class is a place where children learn to think scientifically. This entails reflecting about the inquiry process, formulating questions and thinking about the implications of new ideas. However, in Flanders children score low on the motivation for science, the ability to think about inquiry and formulate questions. To overcome these challenges, we introduced the use of philosophical dialogue in the science class for 9 to 12 year olds. The use of philosophical questions such as "Is a zebra without stripes still a zebra?" or "Can we measure clouds?" stimulates children to explore their own scientific ideas and inspire new inquiries. Thus, children discuss (1) science as an enterprise to obtain reliable knowledge, (2) big science ideas such as life, matter or species and (3) ethical issues related to science such as the responsibility of the scientist or the relevance of sustainability. To scaffold the thinking process of children a method was developed which is called PhiloZoo (in Dutch \textquotesingle FiloZoo\textquotesingle  - www.filozoo.be). This method stimulates five distinct thinking skills: asking questions, doubting, inquiring, thinking about what you (don\textquotesingle t) know and giving arguments. The use of thinking animals, such as the doubting sheep or the reasoning bear, help children to identify with these different thinking perspectives. PhiloZoo was developed in a design-based research process allowing sequential evaluation and adaptation of the method by using research interventions such as expert interviews, observations, and group interviews of children and teachers. This approach allows us to discuss the design principles of introducing philosophical dialogue in the science class and the impact of the method on children\textquotesingle s motivation, thinking skills and the teacher\textquotesingle s skill to apply this method. PhiloZoo was introduced during one year in 7 different primary school classes, reaching around 120 children. Once every week the PhiloZoo animals were introduced in the context of nature and technology education. Preliminary findings suggest the approach created a lot of enthusiasm among both teachers and children for science. The method sparkled many questions that were explored in the science class and lead into further inquiry through experiment or dialogue. Class observations show an increase in children\textquotesingle s use of different thinking skills. We will further discuss these findings during the presentation at the conference.},

    abstract = {Culturally sensitive themes such as the theory of evolution or (homo)sexuality and ethically sensitive topics such as euthanasia or abortion elicit tensions in the science class for both students and teachers alike. These topics can induce resistance among students and even lead to polarization, especially in a context of super diversity where students of many different cultures share a classroom. Although the interaction between natural sciences and society is part of the secondary science curriculum in Flemish schools, science teachers report difficulties to tackle these ethically and culturally sensitive topics related to science. However, not tackling these sensitive issues may lead to alienation of students who may feel less at ease in this science context and may tend to ignore or even repulse the sciences as a whole. There is a need for a method supporting teachers and students when dealing with ethical and culturally sensitive topics in the science class. In this regard, we develop a method aimed at supporting students and teachers based on an Educational Design Research. The first part focuses on teachers. As the teacher\textquotesingle s opinions influence his or her didactic approach, a reflection instrument is developed allowing teachers to reflect upon their views on society, education and the nature of science. Through the discussion of exemplary cases this instrument helps teachers reflect upon their own didactic approach with regard to these sensitive topics. The second part aims at stimulating dialogue among students about these sensitive topics. Students are encouraged to reflect about the values under discussion rather than to jump to conclusions. We also formulate didactic design criteria for such open dialogues to support teachers who guide these dialogues.},

In this chapter, we argue that science teachers can be strengthened to teach the nature of science by incorporating an approach consistent with teaching and learning in philosophy. We will explore how philosophical dialogue with young people in science contexts can enhance reflection about and understanding of the nature of science. We explore the potential of philosophical dialogue to stimulate discussions about the nature of science through sharing our approaches and drawing on research literature relating to dialogic teaching in philosophy and the use of philosophical dialogue in science.},

    abstract = {To enhance scientific literacy among primary and secondary school students, educating about the nature of science (NoS) plays a pivotal role. NoS entails the epistemological underpinnings of science such as its realm and limits or the reasons for its reliability. Whereas decontextualized NoS approaches draw the attention of students to specific NoS issues through analogies or metaphors, highly contextualized approaches focus on the NoS through historical and contemporary science examples. Though these approaches provide metaphors, examples or laboratory activities enabling to pinpoint key aspects of NoS, they often elaborate less on (follow-up) strategies to elicit reflection about general NoSinsights. However, explicit reflection about the NoS is considered necessary for successfully understanding it. To overcome this problem, we explore the role a philosophical dialogue may play. Philosophical dialogue, aimed at eliciting critical and creative thinking through argumentation, can prove a useful method to elicit reflection about science as it (i) helps students to clarify abstract concepts, (ii) allows students to couple abstract epistemological knowledge about science with their own experiences and (iii) facilitates conceptual change by monitoring oneu8217s thinking processes. Combining classic NoS-learning material and philosophical dialogue allows to create a new approach where students collectively explore general scientific or epistemological problems. The teacher does not provide answers, but only facilitates the dialogue by using different kinds of questions leading to hypothesisformation, explication, argumentation and investigation of NoS-related concepts. This way, reflection in NoS-activities is not only approached as a process of clarification and metacognition, but also as a process of argumentation. Thus, reflection is not reduced to an instrument to impregnate the teacheru8217s views on the NoS, but reflection rather functions as a more complex intellectual act that could help students to interpret and discuss autonomously the nature of science.},

Young peopleu8217s perspectives have tended to be under-represented despite the intergenerational consequences of policy in this field. We report on a novel approach to research and practice: the co-creation of a youth guide and policy brief by youth participants and facilitators. The model offers potential use by practitioners for engaging publics at the early stages of technoscientific innovations. Findings fall into two categories: youth priorities for geoengineering and authorial responsibility as a way of supporting youth action. Tentative conclusions from youth participants are (i) action must be prioritised now to mitigate and adapt to climate change, rather than continuing with u8216business as usualu8217; and (ii) there is a need for proactive international cooperation on governance and research on geoengineering to understand potential environmental and social consequences of geoengineering proposals for people at different temporal and spatial scales. Greater public dialogue on geoengineering and its governance is needed, particularly involving young people. The youth guide and policy brief co-authored by participants and facilitators, and the dialogic methods used in their production, can contribute to this dialogue.},

    abstract = {Research aim: Critical thinking is a key skill for secondary school students to master. Especially in times of fake news and populism, one particularly interesting dimension of critical thinking focuses on questioning epistemological assumptions. How can teachers stimulate reflection about the validity and reliability of knowledge among students? In this project, a teaching method is developed aiming to stimulate studentsu8217 critical thinking about knowledge through dialogue, focusing on the context of both history and science education. Dialogue appears to be a relevant instrument for generating critical thinking: dialogue exposes students to their own thinking as well as it encourages young people to argue with each other. However, guiding a dialogue between students can be challenging for teachers who are often more familiar with providing insights as a knowledge authority than generating reflection as a dialogue facilitator. Research questions and design: Following the principles of education-design research, the teaching method with learning material is developed, evaluated and adjusted in consecutive cycles in cooperation with a professional learning community (2021-2024). The didactic material is being evaluated in secondary schools (9th-10th grade) as well as in teacher training programs. Specifically, the project aims to determine the design criteria for the method in order to stimulate studentsu8217 critical thinking about knowledge and reliability (RQ1) as well as the contextual factors that hinder of facilitate the successful implementation of the teaching method, including the attitude of teachers towards the method (RQ2). The goal is also to capture how the method stimulates studentsu8217 critical thinking (RQ3). Currently, the prototype of the teaching material has been developed and try-outs have been executed. Interviews with students and (aspiring-) teachers as well as observations in the classroom were conducted. To further capture how the method stimulates different kinds of critical thinking in both subjects, dialogues of students will be explored and categorized in the next academic year. Results and conclusion: Students and (aspiring-) teachers were enthusiastic about the method. The qualitative data pointed out how dialogue activities can expose the presuppositions about knowledge within science/history. To do so, the learning material must transform these abstract ideas into concrete learning material that makes the thinking of students visible. Every lesson is u8722 in fact u8722 a lesson about knowledge, but the link has to be made explicit. Interestingly, students react differently to the applicability of the dialogical method in the science and history class, exposing differing prevailing assumptions about historic and scientific knowledge (such as, doubt is inherent to history, but has no place in science). However, strong assumptions about science makes it harder to deal with fake news and conflicting views in the media. Teachersu8217 embodiment of science could play a crucial role in these assumptions of students. For example, the element of allowing doubt in class was met with some resistance among teachers, while doubt is part of an investigative attitude among students and inherent to the nature of science. Therefore, it is vital to work on the teachersu8217 insight into reliable knowledge. Teachers indicated to be interested in hands-on material as well as training to ask the right questions and guide learning activities.},

    abstract = {Research aim and questions: Topics such as climate change and other societal challenges at the intersection of technology, science (STEM) and society are gaining an increasingly prominent place in the public debate. Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) tries to prepare young people to participate in this debate and make sustainable choices. Three ways of thinking are central in ESD: system thinking (thinking from a large framework), values thinking (developing one\textquotesingle s values framework) and action thinking (thinking about oneu8217s actions). Both primary and secondary school teachers find it challenging to address these competences. An approach based on philosophical dialogue provides a promising instrument to work on it as it allows students to discuss and explore questions at the crossroads of science and society. This approach allowed to develop a teaching method to help teachers stimulate value thinking, system thinking and action thinking of 10- to 14-year-olds. In this study we aim to answer the questions: RQ1 What conditions should the method meet to promote young people\textquotesingle s systems, values and action thinking in the STEM-class? RQ2 What is the attitude of teachers regarding the developed method? RQ3 Which contextual factors hinder and facilitate the implementation of the method in schools? Methodology: Through an Education Design Research approach, a teaching method was developed, tested, evaluated and adapted over the past three years. The method had been implemented in several Flemish schools,. These include try-outs in primary and secondary education in cooperation with a researcher through a three-step model in which the teacher observes, assists and executes; (b) try-outs with pre-service teachers in their teaching training; (c) try-outs with in-service teachers during training sessions. Class observations were performed and interviews with all participants were conducted during these try-outs. Results and conclusion: RQ1 We develop more than 15 different types of exercises in five themes: climate, biodiversity, water, waste, and technology. Exercises which make thinking visible, for example by taking positions in space, especially stimulate students. This approach strengthens substantive involvement for STEM and sustainability, and meets teachers needs by linking ESD content to different STEM contexts. RQ2 The material has been positively evaluated by teachers. RQ3 An important requirement of this method is the attitude of teacher who facilitates the exercises. The teacher should only ask open questions and not give answers himself. When asked about the challenges teachers experience, teachers indicate that these mainly relate to this requirement. They want to intervene in a directive way and they experience discomfort with confusion among students. Teachers also point out that the language skills of students is a defining context factor. However, the absence of right and wrong answers in philosophizing also turns out to be a tool to get children with lower language proficiency to talk. Ready-to-use learning material and thorough training in the field of dialogue skills appear to be central to learning the method. Implications of our findings for teacher training in ESD education will also be discussed.},

    abstract = {How can we help secondary school students to think critically about history? The discipline of history is built on theoretical and epistemological ideas about knowledge, time, and history. Helping students to explore these philosophical topics provide opportunities to stimulate their critical thinking skills as it challenges students to take a birdu8217s eye perspective on the nature of history. This contrasts with historical questions that are usually discussed in history education, questions that can be answered by studying historical sources. Philosophical questions about history cover topics such as the nature of time, knowledge, ethics, or causation, e.g. u8216Is it possible to live outside of time?u8217 or u8216Does a historian understand the war better than a victim?u8217. Through philosophical dialogues, teachers can stimulate reflection about theoretical concepts as the teacher acts as a dialogue facilitator scaffolding the thinking process of students by asking further questions. These are questions that inspire students to provide arguments, clarifications, or new perspectives. Through Educational Design Research, this project (2022-2024) cyclically develops a teaching method to stimulate studentsu8217 critical thinking about history inspired by philosophical dialogue. This study aims to determine the design criteria for the method (RQ1), capture how (student-) teachers respond to this approach (RQ2). First, a literature review and expert interviews allow to formulate a first version of design criteria for the teaching method, leading to the development of the prototype of the didactic material. Subsequently, the teaching method is introduced in four Flemish secondary school classes and in four groups of (pre-service and in-service) teacher development. Teachers interviews allow answering RQ2. RQ1 Four design criteria surfaced in our study: (I) use simple and inspiring philosophical questions to enhance student reflection, (II) challenge students through different thinking exercises to stimulate taking alternative perspectives and exploring different philosophical ideas, (III) imbed the philosophical approach in different historical contexts to connect abstract to concrete ideas, (IV) facilitate the dialogues by taking the Socratic stance, meaning that the teacher refrains from expressing his/hers- opinion during the dialogue. RQ2 In the try-outs, teachers indicate that they already work on studentsu8217 knowledge about the discipline, but interviews revealed that they often only did in an implicit way. Teachers observe that the philosophical approach helps to explicate the nature of historical knowledge. Furthermore, teachers indicated that they have some resistance towards allowing doubt in class. Indeed, in a society where fake news and uncertainty about scientific and historical facts is rife, a logical response may be to emphasize that some knowledge is fixed and banish doubt in class. However, engaging in philosophical dialogues about doubt and knowledge can scaffold studentsu8217 thinking about knowledge and truth. We will discuss the opportunities and challenges of implementing philosophical dialogue in history classes, and explore what this approach means for teacher training programs.},

    abstract = {Background: Mis- and disinformation in the science field, such as climate change denial and vaccine hesitancy, are pressing issues that affect society. While science teachers often delegate the task of teaching students to deal with fake news to social science classes, it is important for students to learn how scientists arrive at reliable knowledge to combat these issues. The science class is the ideal context to teach students to reflect on science critically. Although science teachers want to stimulate critical thinking about science, they express the need for a didactic approach to deal with studentsu8217 statements such as "Because scientists are not 100\% sure, we should not believe them.\textquotedblright  Aim: This research project aims to develop a teaching method for 9th and 10th grade teachers that fosters critical thinking about science through the concept of Nature of Science (NoS). NoS refers to the epistemological aspects of science that science educators deem relevant for students. The teaching method is inspired by philosophical dialogue, where students research a philosophical question in a community of inquiry guided by a teacher-facilitator (e.g., \textquotedblleft Are scientists allowed to doubt?u8217). The research will identify the design criteria that the teaching method should meet to stimulate reflection about NoS (RQ1) and the challenges and opportunities of implementing philosophical dialogue in the science class expressed by students, pre- and in-service teachers (RQ2). Method: Following the principles of education-design research, the teaching method with learning material is developed, evaluated, and adjusted in consecutive cycles in cooperation with a professional learning community. The didactic material is evaluated in secondary schools and workshops for pre-service and in-service teachers. A small scale try-out of the prototype of the learning material has been executed by members of the research team in both contexts (5 classes and 3 workshops). Semi-structured focus group interviews among students and teachers, field notes, and surveys are analysed through Directed Content Analysis. Results: Seven design criteria are identified (RQ1), such as couple abstract reflection to concrete science contexts, allow students to engage in dialogues about science, and let the teacher facilitate dialogues by asking questions such as : Why do you think so? Or u8216Who disagrees?u8217 Why?. The design criteria lead to hands-on and minds-on learning activities on different science subjects that vary in the degree and the way of contextualisation within science contents, divided in four categories (abstract, experimental, historical, and socio-scientific). Teachers express enthusiasm for the teaching method, as it helps them scaffold student thinking, and students show high engagement in the exercises (RQ2). Preliminary results show that reflection about science through philosophical dialogue can lead to a critical examination of scientific claims rather than blindly accepting or rejecting them. However, facilitating philosophical dialogues is challenging for teachers, and adequate support is needed to move from exercise to explicit reflection. Discussion: The implications of this pilot study for schools, teacher education, and teacher professionalization will be discussed. This research project provides a novel approach to addressing mis- and disinformation in the science field, empowering students to think critically about scientific claims.},
