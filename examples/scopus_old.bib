	abstract     = {This article seeks to investigate the cultural and ideological processes conditioning the reception of Prometheus Bound ascribed to Aeschylus in the so far unexplored poetic drama Prometheus or The Play of a Day (1978) by the renowned Modern Greek poet Nikiforos Vrettakos. It is argued that his rewriting of the tragic myth bears the features of a palimpsest, whose layers include archetypal features of Prometheus Bound, such as the Titan's dignified struggle, his philanthropy, and the concept of human progress, filtered in varying ways through the mediating receptions (Goethe, Camus, Kazantzakis, Sikelianos, Varnalis, Michalakeas) of the ancient exemplum. At the same time, Vrettakos chooses to deploy Prometheus as his self-image and grafts the poetic ego onto the title-character to raise critical awareness and convey his ideological and ethical stance. These elements contribute to the play's distinctiveness, as well as its power to move beyond the immediate socio-political circumstances of the military dictatorship in Greece (1967-1974) and offer a diachronic perspective on intrinsic aspects of the human condition: the dignified resistance to oppression, the limits of human intellect and the sense of humanism emerging from the perception of mankind and nature as an inseparable entity - a feature of Vrettakos' poetics par excellence. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

	abstract     = {Throughout humanities’ history, telling the truth has always been seen or for that matter understood, as a challenge, as a defiance of the status quo or what is established or known, and could very easily be torn down by an announced truth at any given moment. That is the main reason a speaker, in most cases, will avoid expressing their interpretation of what is real and true, and will prefer to intentionally alter it with convenient and accommodating lies that will not result in any type of discomfort for the people around them. This text presents a general overview of three very important and crucial moments in history, in which daring to tell the truth came to be the very philosophical foundation and gave some specific characters in history the importance and relevance they have been given today. First, it covers a brief review of the ancient Greek term Parrhesia, its relation to other relevant philosophical terms and its importance within the different philosophy schools of the era. Later, the process of how truth is started to be manipulated from a Christian stance and later the proposal of relativity from Friedrich Nietzsche. Finally, there will be a reflection about Michael Foucault’s proposal that relates parrhesia to the care of the self. As a conclusion, an open discussion focusing on the recent post-truth issues illustrating the mechanics involved since ancient times in regard to telling the truth. © 2022, Universidad Politecnica Salesiana.

Specifically, I demonstrate that later Greek and Latin authors use the Odyssey’s secondary incipit to emphasize narratorial subjectivity and to mark new literary beginnings.

Such images facilitate encounters with “specters” of the authors, invoking their bodily presence in the absence of their physical body. They are encodings of collective memory but also participants in perpetuating and sometimes modifying the physical appearance of apostolic figures. On occasion, the blending of textual incipits with apostolic images sublimate authorial identity and textual identity; the bodies of apostles become frames through which to view their written works. Although they are paratexts, apostolic icons can rearrange and aggregate other paratextual features including titles and even Euthaliana. Images of the apostles further interact with anonymous features of NT manuscripts, such as Euthaliana, providing authorization for works without ascription in the manuscripts themselves. Images of the apostles in NT manuscripts are therefore more than decoration or pious creativity. They are loci of presence, identity, memory, and authority. © 2022 by the author.

These fragmentary translations reveal that early Tudor writers had a wider array of options in their methods of classical translation than has hitherto been appreciated. They also call for more nuanced consideration of the diverse intellectual, political, and literary contexts that spurred poetic innovation in late Henrician England. © Edinburgh University Press.},

This paper highlights the pitfalls of a purely metrological approach to this problem and proposes a formal differentiation between metrologically defined ancient measuring units and other measures used to estimate long distances. The common-sense approach to the problem is strengthened by some cross-over documentary evidence for usage of the so-called itinerary stadion in antiquity. We discuss the possibility of using statistical analysis methods to estimate the length of the stadion by comparing ancient routes with the actual distances. Simple numerical examples explain the limits of this approach, caused by the low number of data and by their mixed character. A special case of distances which can be calculated with the help of coordinates given in Ptolemy’s Geography is discussed, and has been shown to lead unavoidably to ambiguous solutions. © 2022, The Author(s).},

Adopting a behavioural criterion for demarcating shame from guilt, I examine the most promising description of a guilt-feeling from Aristotle’s Ethics. The description stands out from the earlier tradition by reversing the pattern of the behavioural tendencies of a wrongdoer, but fits well with the phenomenon of inner shame. The condition described by Aristotle can thus be conceived as self-shaming, but one that exhibits some of the features that have more in common with guilt. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract     = {The development of ancient epistolography could be associated with the very development of literacy in Greece. Apart from its original function, to transfer a notice to a distant person, the letter has expanded its realm over time. Through an overview of the letters preserved in the Greek language area and in the works of Greek authors, we can see various functions the letter assumed – both in everyday life and in literature. Numerous accounts and fragments of letters, from short business notice on lead tablets to private letters written on papyrus, which served as a means for preserving familiar or friendly relationships, point to a great popularity of the letter in ancient times. Given the flexibility of its form and the possibility of its usage on a number of occasions, whether public or private, both by the educated and by the uneducated, we notice that the epistolary form, as a means of communication, soon became firmly rooted in the Greek cultural area. The paper aims at highlighting the very beginning of developing the form of letter in Greece, its basic elements and characteristics, as well as the terms used for it in the Greek language. © 2022, Faculty of Philology Banja Luka.

Patočka argues that the only way to escape spiritual decline is through sacrifice. This study examines how the ethical is represented in Patočka’s philosophy. It focuses on his two main concepts of sacrifice and care for the soul and explores the relationship between them. Through a close reading of Plato and Europe (1973), ‘Four Seminars’ (1973), and his essay ‘The dangers of technicization’ (1973), this study reveals how Patočka proposes that the ethical can be implemented within the realm of the political. Drawing a parallel between Socrates’ and Patočka’s lives and fates, this study points to the significance of ethics in political life – both in the ancient Greek polis of Socrates’ time and in communist Czechoslovakia in Patočka’s time. This approach highlights the influence that the philosophy of Socrates had on Patočka’s thinking. © 2022 Sciendo. All rights reserved.},

	abstract     = {The cartographic and historiographic traditions interpreting the Greek toponym Erythra Thalassa indicate this expression could designate several water basins in classical historiography, though it is usually rendered univocally as the Red Sea. This research applies cognitive semantics to the history of geography to retrieve the encyclopaedic meaning of the term erythros in relation to its dictionary meaning "red". Computationally generated lists of frequency from about 50 ancient Greek and Latin oeuvres denote a predominant toponymic use of the term and a fixed collocation in conjunction with thalassa "sea". Additional statistical data extrapolated from the Septuagint and the Greek New Testament reveal the tendency in the biblical tradition to use exclusively the inflected form erythra in fully fixed collocations with the term thalassa. The paper finds out that the specific shade of red denoted by erythors has been used since the seventh century BCE in a number of other toponyms and ethnonyms to convey the conceptual meaning of "southern". To comparatively verify this hypothesis, several Greek toponyms incorporating the term leukos-"white"or "western"-are discussed in relation to their relative position in the oikumene. Based on comparative chronologies and diatopic attestations of the phenomenon, the hypothesis that the Turkic colour cardinal points system and the linguistic means to convey it was introduced to Greece during the period of contact with the Scythe people is proposed. © 2022 Moreno Bonda, published by Sciendo.},

	abstract     = {Cuneiform tablets appertain to the oldest textual artifacts used for more than three millennia and are comparable in amount and relevance to texts written in Latin or ancient Greek. These tablets are typically found in the Middle East and were written by imprinting wedge-shaped impressions into wet clay. There is an increasing demand in the Digital Humanities domain for handwriting recognition, i.e., machine reading of handwritten script, focusing on historic documents. Current practice in text analysis of cuneiform script relies heavily on transliteration and translation, which are incomplete and influenced by the knowledge and experience of the expert that created them. The development of computational tools for cuneiform analysis presents many opportunities. An efficient and accurate sign spotting enables cross-referencing and statistical analyzes that are infeasible to perform manually. Furthermore, a wedge constellation spotting tool, provides experts with a significantly broader base of references to create more accurate and less time consuming transliterations and translations. Yet, cuneiform script has since resisted efforts to computational processing on basis of its basic constituents, its 3D wedge-shaped impressions and their free-form arrangements into signs. In this work, we review the literature on computational processing and recognition in the domain of cuneiform script. We introduce the different heterogeneous sources of cuneiform script, namely, manual ink-on-paper drawings, digital vector graphics drawings, photographs, and 3D scans of tablets. We describe the development of methods, beginning with the first computational classification using a hybrid manual encoding and computational comparison, to the latest methods making use of Generative Adversarial Neural Networks to recognize characters automatically. Finally, we give an overview of applications of these methods that enable quantitative mining in the small, e.g., patterns of wedge constellations, and in the large, e.g., networks of economic activity. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

Schwab's essay was criticised as early as 1794 by J. F. Ch. Gräffe. In a 1789 essay, J. A. Eberhard had also denied the originality of Kant's division of judgments and made certain indications suggesting that Aristotle was aware of the distinction. In this paper, I propose a fresh examination of why Schwab is wrong to attribute knowledge of Kant's division of judgments to Stilpo - a second look which, however, does not disregard Gräffe's contributions to the discussion. Second, I argue that, in a precise sense, Kant's division of judgments is indeed original, but that the analytic - synthetic distinction was nevertheless in a sense known to Aristotle. The assessment of these alleged precedents sheds light no only on the novelty of Kant's philosophical project but also on what may be called the “the paradox of the discovery of an evident philosophical distinction”. © 2022 Vittorio Klostermann.

The latter half of the paper employs a prototype theory framework to analyse the model's distributional information in the construction of new dictionary entries for each kinship term. Such NLP-based research highlights the importance of encyclopaedic information for the construction of lexical entries; it also significantly improves upon earlier attempts at categorisation for Koine Greek (Louw and Nida 1988), which fall victim to using the L1 categories of the lexicographer in the construction of semantic domains for the ancient language. © 2021 Oxford University Press.

To this end, I study the words and expressions that designate a people's ancestral past: first, I discuss the different meanings of the term patrios in the Greek literature of the 5th and 4th centuries (Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Aristophanes, Aristoteles, Attic orators); second, I present the political core-concept within which the generations of the classical period referred to their ancestors; and, finally, I examine those elements that form a classical polis' identity. It turns out that the notions of 'ancestral' and 'traditional' are vague and their particular significance depends upon the perspective of those who use them, as well as upon the historical period in which they appear. Additionally, they reveal the way in which the ancient individuals expressed their reaction - positive or negative - towards the multiple transformations that their societies underwent. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

Yet how did material from this Second Temple composition become part of a late ancient Christian anthology? This article interrogates the transmission of Jubilees material in catena manuscripts of Genesis. Rather than offering direct witness to Greek manuscripts of Jubilees, this material had already been appropriated and restructured before the compilers of catena manuscripts collected and reorganized it around the textual frame of Greek Genesis. Two conduits account for the availability of this material: the use of Jubilees among late ancient chronographers and a widespread genealogical tradition, derived from Jubilees, that names the wives of biblical patriarchs. In late antiquity, the Book of Jubilees often circulated not as a unified composition but as individual units which were assimilated into other structuring frameworks, whether the schemata of chronographers or the (margins of) the Greek Bible itself. The late ancient reception of Jubilees thus foreshadows the atomism of modern text-critical appropriations. The conclusions of this article invite similar exploration for other Second Temple texts. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract     = {The article examines the collaborations between the pensionnaires of the Villa Medici in Rome and the members of the French School of Athens, shedding light on the complex relationships between architecture, art, and archeology. The second half of the 19th century was a period during which the exchanges and collaborations between archaeologists, artists, and architects acquired a reinvented role and a dominant place. Within such a context, Athens was the place par excellence, where the encounter between these three disciplines took place. The main objective of the article is to render explicit how the revelations of archeology, actively disseminated by the members of the French School of Athens—the “Athéniens”—had an important impact on the approach of certain pensionnaires of the Villa Medici in Rome. Particular emphasis is placed on certain pensionnaires, who decided to devote their envois to ancient monuments of Greece. In parallel, the article intends to shed light on the methods that helped the pensionnaires-architects of the Villa Medici in Rome appropriate archaeological discoveries concerning Greek antiquities. The article takes, as a starting point, the following hypothesis: to better understand the figure of the architect-archaeologist, of whom Jacques Ignace Hittorff is an emblematic example, it is pivotal to bear in mind that before the second half of the 19th century neither the figure of Hellenic archeology nor the figure of the architect had yet acquired their autonomy. Taking into account that Johann Joachim Winckelmann, in the middle of the 18th century, forged an ideal Greek model, which was criticized during the second half of the 19th century, the article also sheds light on the fact that the revelations of archaeologists have called into question the Winckelmannian image of Greece. Another aspect that is explored in the article is Jacques Ignace Hittorff’s studies concerning the polychromy of ancient Greek monuments, paying special attention to his Restitution du temple d’Empédocle à Sélinonte ou l’Architecture polychrome chez les Grecs. The article also explores how the shifts of the status of philhellenism are related to the mutations of the meaning of travel to Greece. In parallel, it investigates the impact of Greek independence on the ideals of beauty and nature in arts, as well as how Greek independence is related to the intensification of the interest in the excavations of Greek antiquities. © 2022 by the author.

	abstract     = {One important part of ancient urbanism studies has been focused on analysing the typology and evolution of ‘private’ house. Part of these particular buildings with both public and private functions evolved over time, showing the different necessities of the society in each period. The Tetrastylon project aims to solve a surprising issue related to an often poorly identified Roman house. Under the identification of atrium house, two different typologies with important social significance divergences have been merged. On the one hand, researchers have identified the canonical axial Roman house (with some small variations due to urbanistic evolutions) with an open court (atrium). On the other hand, under the classification of atrium house, scholars have also identified another domestic structure which is built around an atrium, but following a Greek scheme of housing. This typology of Roman house, which chronologically appeared after the influence of the classic atrium house has only been detected in Roman cities with a Greek background. The project Tetrastylon is focused on the Magna Grecia and Sicily in the last centuries of Republican time, when many of the Greek colonies became Roman cities or were Roman focus. This area of the Roman Empire is a good goal in order to analyse an important number of these buildings and the result of changing a Greek peristyle for an atrium into a Hellenistic scheme of house. Finally, this typology is also usually confused with the Greek peristyle house as the architectural structures are similar, and the main difference is the morphology of the open space. To clearly identify this typology, conceptually localized between the Greek peristyle and the Roman atrium house, this project has used several archaeological analyses on the three types of dwellings. However, one of the methodological approaches of Tetrastylon has been designed to use computational models for analysing the structure and functioning of this ‘new’ typology. For this reason, in this paper, we present a combination of Space Syntax, axial maps and visibility relational models applied in all domestic structures with the purpose of finding crucial and unquestionable differences between those building models. The results of these techniques have generated new data that complement the archaeological and historical information about these houses, offering a new perspective about the social behaviour of their owners as well as the complexity of Roman urbanism. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract     = {Two major themes dominate the poetry of the Alexandrian poet, C. P. Cavafy: homosexual desire and Greekness, broadly defined. This paper explores the interconnectivity of these motifs, showing how Cavafy’s poetic queerness is expressed through his relationship with the ancient Greek world, especially Hellenistic Alexandria. I focus on Cavafy’s incorporation of ancient sculpture into his poetry and the ways that sculpture, for Cavafy, is a vehicle for expressing forbidden desires in an acceptable way. In this, I draw on the works of Liana Giannakopoulou on statuary in modern Greek poetry and Dimitris Papanikolaou on Cavafy’s homosexuality and its presentation in the poetry. Sculpture features in around a third of Cavafy’s poems and pervades it in various ways: the inclusion of physical statues as focuses of ecphrastic description, the use of sculptural language and metaphor, and the likening of Cavafy’s beloveds to Greek marbles of the past, to name but three. This article argues that Cavafy utilizes the statuary of the ancient Greek world as raw material, from which he sculpts his modern Greek queerness, variously desiring the statuesque bodies of contemporary Alexandrian youths and constructing eroticized depictions of ancient Greek marbles. The very ontology of queerness is, for Cavafy, ‘created’ using explicitly sculptural metaphors (e.g. the repeated uses of the verb κάνω [‘to make’] in descriptions of ‘those made like me’) and he employs Hellenistic statues as a productive link between his desires and so-called ‘Greek desire’, placing himself within a continuum of queer, Greek men. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract     = {I present a systematic interpretation of the foundational purpose of constructions in ancient Greek geometry. I argue that Greek geometers were committed to an operationalist foundational program, according to which all of mathematics—including its entire ontology and epistemology—is based entirely on concrete physical constructions. On this reading, key foundational aspects of Greek geometry are analogous to core tenets of 20th-century operationalist/positivist/constructivist/intuitionist philosophy of science and mathematics. Operationalism provides coherent answers to a range of traditional philosophical problems regarding classical mathematics, such as the epistemic warrant and generality of diagrammatic reasoning, superposition, and the relation between constructivism and proof by contradiction. Alleged logical flaws in Euclid (implicit diagrammatic reasoning, superposition) can be interpreted as sound operationalist reasoning. Operationalism also provides a compelling philosophical motivation for the otherwise inexplicable Greek obsession with cube duplication, angle trisection, and circle quadrature. Operationalism makes coherent sense of numerous specific choices made in this tradition, and suggests new interpretations of several solutions to these problems. In particular, I argue that: Archytas’s cube duplication was originally a single-motion machine; Diocles’s cissoid was originally traced by a linkage device; Greek conic section theory was thoroughly constructive, based on the conic compass; in a few cases, string-based constructions of conic sections were used instead; pointwise constructions of curves were rejected in foundational contexts by Greek mathematicians, with good reason. Operationalism enables us to view the classical geometrical tradition as a more unified and philosophically aware enterprise than has hitherto been recognised. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Her concept of the political eludes the tradition-inherited approach and subtracts the praxis from instrumental reason. Arendt revisits the political experiences of ancient Greek cities, where tragedy and assembly, theater and agora, provide the propitious space for action. She avoids the instrumental approach of homo faber, conceptualizes action as performance and shows its connaturality with the performing arts, to the detriment of the productive ones. In “What is Freedom?” Arendt understands political freedom as a “worldly fact”, and assesses the Machiavellian virtù as public excellence: as performance on stage. © Global Knowledge Academics, authors.

The discourse on idols and idolatry played a central role in the history of Western ideas about religion and religious diversity, framing much of the Christian debates on non-Christian religions, and eventually, on the origins of religion as such (e.g., Hume). It is here argued that idolatry is in fact, from the start, a word for religion, albeit “false religions.” Following a comparative discussion on the respective semantics of idolatry in Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, this essay shows how the category emerged at the intersection of ancient Jewish and Greek debates on religion and images, before being appropriated and put to use by early Christian authors. The essay then compares the Jewish and Christian discourse of idolatry in late antiquity. It is here argued that the different narratives developed in this context played a central role in the emergence of an anthropocentric versus a theocentric history of religions in the early modern period. © 2022 The University of Chicago.

Besides the vast amount of ecclesiastical references and commentaries, it also deals with Marcionite and Gnostic views. It demonstrates that Christians most often read the prophets as testimonies to Christ and the communities of those who believed in him. Allegorical readings came up soon and were justified by Origen of Alexandria (185–254 CE), whose interpretations were most influential in subsequent centuries. In the fourth century, a reaction against the allegorical reading of the prophets arose in Antioch, Syria; the “Antiochene school” rather limited its approach to the historical context of the prophets, except for texts read Christologically in the New Testament.

The sites include two cities founded as Greek colonies: Epidamnus/Dyrrachion (modern-day Durrës) and Apollonia in Illyria. Skeletons date to the Archaic-Hellenistic periods (seventh–first centuries BC), Roman periods (first century BC to fourth century AD), Late Antiquity (fifth–seventh centuries AD), and the Medieval period (eighth–fourteenth centuries AD), a large time span which encompasses dramatic social and political changes and partial population replacements associated with colonization and warfare. Results from all periods show a diet based on C3, terrestrial foods. Despite no temporal trends, diet is most varied during Late Antiquity. Oral health of individuals interred within cities is worse than among individuals interred outside city walls, suggesting diet differences specifically linked to city life. Oral pathology variations are not mirrored in isotopic data, reflecting the fact that oral health is influenced not only by ingredients in the diet, but also by food processing techniques, hormones, oral hygiene, oral bacteria, and genetics. While two-thirds of the individuals from Epidamnus/Dyrrachion are estimated to have been born and raised elsewhere, none of the individuals from cemeteries outside Apollonia’s walls are, suggesting greater population movement associated with cities. This study joins other research showing stability in people’s diets across broad time scales, whether due to constraint, resilience, or resistance to change, and demonstrates a high level of migration to ancient Mediterranean cities. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Therefore, physicians advised that people should follow an individualized regimen to prevent and treat the disease in natural body, and that, simultaneously, the government should prompt all institutions at different levels to function well in accordance with the harmony concept in classical medicine, so as to ensure the health of political body. What all this embodies is the political community's ideal of respecting difference and pursuing harmony. In Utopia, the citizens of the namesake island country plant herbs in their family garden and establish a perfect medical system to contain the plague in their cities. This constitutes a sharp contrast to the miserable medical situations in London that More, the author of the story, experienced when he was dealing with the plague as the acting administrator. More's participation in public affairs and his writing about a utopian nation display his determination to protect the collapsing national community. The Utopians read, with avidity, the books about the ancient Greek medicine, brought by More's good friend, and practice the ideas of body-building, regimen, and harmony in pursuit of the good health of natural body, political body, and global body. Also, they send officials to help neighboring countries' healthy development while still respecting their different ways of civilization.

	abstract     = {In referencing Rena Fraden’s 2001 Imagining Medea: Rhodessa Jones and Theatre for Incarcerated Women and Kevin J. Wetmore, Jr.’s 2013 Black Medea: Adaptations in Modern Plays, I suggest that transposing Euripides’s myth into modern black contexts often endows ancient Greek drama with epistemological primacy, whether seeking the “universal” redemption it has long exemplified, or resisting that primacy through the return to a “past” or “heritage” foreclosed by the catastrophe of racial slavery. My critique is not of the substance of the works these two books showcase, all of which constitute important contributions to theater activism. Rather, I aim to expose the transpositional limits of the figure of Medea, whose racial marking (to which I suggest Euripides hints, whether consciously or not), while signifying as stranger/outsider, is often obscured by a gendered, geographical and/or existential “othering,” rather than recognized as a plight of ontological proportion. As such, a blackened Medea can appear to possess the (structural) capacity afforded by her godly, supra-subject position. But what are the incalculable depths of her subjection and dishonor when her blackening pitches her “being” into an ontological dilemma that neither catharsis, nor the intervention of a deus ex machina can recuperate?

	abstract     = {Archimedes' Sand-Reckoner presents a system for naming extraordinarily large numbers, larger than the number of grains of sand that would fill the cosmos. Curiously, Archimedes addresses the treatise not to another specialist but to King Gelon II of Syracuse. While the treatise has thus been seen as evidence for the dynamics of patronage, difficulties in both Archimedes' treatment of Gelon and his discussion of astronomical models make it fit incongruously within contemporary court and scientific contexts. This article offers a new reading of the Sand-Reckoner based on a reconsideration of the relationship between author and addressee: deferring assumptions about the historicity of that relationship, it analyzes Gelon's role in the treatise with respect to both the stylistic features of Archimedes' prose and a broader tradition of narratives about a variety of cultural actors who engage with kings, speaking not so much truth as wit to power. Such a reading resolves the social and scientific difficulties of the treatise, and develops the literary-experimental qualities of Hellenistic science. In turn, the article proposes a revised approach, sensitive to broader patterns of authorship, to understanding ancient scientific authors' relationship to royal authority. It concludes, finally, that the royal patronage seemingly exemplified by the Sand-Reckoner had greater significance as a cultural trope than as a social institution. © 2022 by The Regents of the University of California},

	abstract     = {The dialogical exchange with a fictitious opponent is the main feature of the so-called Cynic-Stoic Diatribe, a mode of exposition that was developed in Ancient Greek and Roman literature. In Greek diatribe, the formula {greek word presented} from it' is used to reject the views of the fictitious opponent. The Apostle Paul, whose writings exhibit many features of diatribe, makes ample use of this formula. In the Church Slavonic translation of the New Testament, {greek word presented} appears as {greek word presented} or (less often) {greek word presented}. In the Fourth (Athonitic) redaction of this translation, {greek word presented} is used throughout. This text served as the basis for the first printed edition of the second part of the New Testament, the Apostolos (Vilna, 1525). The editor, Franciscus Skorina, tried-albeit in a very inconsistent manner-to modernize the text. He either retained the diatribal formula {greek word presented} or replaced it by {greek word presented}. This diversity arose independently of the Czech Bible of Venice (1506), which was the second main source of Skorina's Bible translations. The use of the 1st person plural ({greek word presented}) reflects similar forms in the preceding context of Paul's Letter to the Romans. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},
