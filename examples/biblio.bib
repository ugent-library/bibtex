  abstract     = {{En este artículo, se analiza la novela 2666 de Roberto Bolaño como emblemática de la tradición narrativa posapocalíptica, donde se pone de manifiesto el agotamiento del poder, el final de una época que no conoce zonas no contaminadas por la violencia. De allí que la representación más adecuada del mundo contemporáneo aparezca como una pesadilla caracterizada por esa violencia y por la guerra permanente, verdaderas sinécdoques de la historia contemporánea. 2666 clausura el siglo XX expresando dos naufragios: el primero atañe a la militancia de la izquierda, en la que todavía creía la generación del propio Bolaño, representada por un personaje, Amalfitano, que encarna las derrotas y pérdidas del proyecto revolucionario. El segundo naufragio es el que ha afectado a una concepción humanista del arte; en la actualidad, se asume que la literatura ya raramente incomoda o ilumina. Atrás ha quedado la sacralización de la figura del artista que marcó el período modernista de nuestra cultura, por lo que el arte ha perdido su poder emancipador, ha dejado de ser una fuerza civilizadora para ponerse al servicio de regímenes totalitarios, o para disolverse en el triunfo banal de la industria cultural. El texto parece proponer que para recuperar cierta legitimidad, en una obra debe coincidir el compromiso estético con el ético, por lo que los procesos de ficcionalización no pueden entenderse como meros proyectos estéticos.}},

  abstract     = {{The ongoing popularity in some second and third generation migrants in Western Europe of marrying a partner from the countries of origin of their (grand) parents is considered to be problematic for micro and macro level societal integration of some migrant populations. Partner choice and marriage practices in migrant communities are problematized in public, media and political discourses by discriminating them from marriage practices in the 'native' population on the basis of three related dichotomies: (1) agency versus structure, (2) us versus them and (3) romantic versus instrumental marriage intentions dichotomies. By means of in-depth qualitative research methodologies on the partner choice processes of women and men of Turkish, Moroccan, Algerian, Tunisian, Punjabi Sikh, Pakistani and Albanian descent in Belgium and an intersectional theoretical approach, this article aims to deconstruct popular and simplifying dichotomous representations of partner choice processes in these migrant populations. Our study reveals how religious, gender and social class boundaries are stretched to meet personal/individual desires and preferences. Individuals do experience social restrictions when it concerns social group boundaries and the potential partners that they can look for. At the same time individuals are never fully determined by their social environment, they creatively develop strategies to by-pass certain restrictions and to some extent are able to meet their personal needs while being sensitive to the desires of their social environment.}},

  abstract     = {{Introduction: The advent of advanced electrophysiological procedures such as 3D electro-anatomical mapping and radiofrequency ablation currently allows for diagnosis and treatment of right atrial arrhythmias in horses.1,2 In contrast, left atrial arrhythmias are scarcely studied3 due to the perilous arterial approach that is needed to access the left atrium. In small animal and human medicine, the transseptal puncture, which is performed via the femoral vein, is a commonly used technique to access the left atrium via the oval fossa in a safe and efficient way. In human medicine, the transhepatic approach has been reported as an alternative to the femoral approach, as the oval fossa is accessed from a similar direction and ensures similar catheter manipulations. Indeed, a caudal approach towards the oval fossa is favourable to position the puncture assembly into the pouchlike anatomy of the oval fossa and direct it towards the left atrium. In contrast, the majority of catheterizations in horses is performed via the jugular vein, which implies a cranial instead of a caudal access to the heart. Moreover, fluoroscopy, which is most commonly used to perform the transseptal puncture in small animals and humans, provides limited to no imaging guidance to allow catheter manipulation in horses due to the size of the equine thorax. Similarly, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging cannot be used either to provide insight into the detailed anatomy of the interatrial septum in an adult horse. Therefore, the goal of this study was to develop a transseptal puncture protocol using a transhepatic and a jugular vein approach under ultrasound guidance.
Methods: All horses in the study were donated for scientific research and owner informed consent was obtained. In 17 horses, a transseptal puncture was performed under general anaesthesia: in nine horses the jugular vein approach was performed, in six horses both the jugular vein and transhepatic approach was performed, and in two horses the transhepatic approach was performed. For the jugular vein approach, a 0.035″ J-tipped or pigtail guidewire followed by 8.5F steerable sheath-dilator assembly was introduced via the right jugular vein and positioned in front of the oval fossa. For the transhepatic approach, a puncture site for transhepatic access was determined on the left or right abdominal wall by locating a clearly visible hepatic vein of at least 8mm in diameter using transthoracic ultrasound. The hepatic vein was punctured using a 9cm long 18G needle, allowing the introduction of a 0.032″ guidewire and subsequent dilator and 8.5F steerable sheath and positioning in front of the oval fossa. The 0.032″ guidewire was then exchanged for a 0.035″ J-tipped or pigtail guidewire. For both approaches, the procedure continued with positioning of the distal tip of the guidewire against the oval fossa and puncture by applying radiofrequency energy on the guidewire, after which dilator and sheath were advanced into the left atrium. The entire procedure was guided using transthoracic and intracardiac echocardiography, and continuous ECG-monitoring was performed. The horses were euthanized at the end of the procedure and lesion size and permeability were evaluated post-mortem.
Results: In 13/17 horses, a successful transseptal puncture was achieved, accounting for 14/15 jugular vein approaches and 5/8 transhepatic approaches (total of 23 punctures). In four horses, the transhepatic puncture was performed on the right side, in the other four on the left side. On post-mortem evaluation, permeable lesions of 1-5 mm were visible in all horses in the oval fossa on the right atrial side and ventral to pulmonary vein ostium III on the left atrial side. The most challenging part of the procedure was the over-the-wire insertion of the dilator-sheath assembly into the left atrium due to the thickness of the equine interatrial septum and limited catheter support. In five horses, atrial fibrillation was already present before the puncture, in 12 procedures paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or paroxysmal atrial tachycardia occurred in response to the puncture and in one horse persistent atrial fibrillation developed. Procedural failure in four horses was due to inability to advance dilator-sheath assembly (N=2), termination of the procedure due to technical failure (N=1), and inability to advance the guidewire towards the heart during a transhepatic approach (N=1). Ultrasound guidance, and especially intracardiac echocardiography (Figure 1), was adequate to guide the procedure.  
Limitations: Although care was taken to perform the second puncture on another location in the oval fossa in the horses in which both methods were applied, it cannot be excluded that the second puncture was realised via the first puncture site. Not all procedures were performed with the same devices. Post-operative complications could not be evaluated as the horses were euthanized for reasons not related to the study.  
Conclusion: Both transseptal puncture techniques allowed to access the left atrium in a minimally invasive way. Further research is needed to establish in which cases which approach would be most appropriate, to investigate which devices yield the most effective results and to determine post-operative complication rate.}},

  abstract     = {{In the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant rejects the traditional metaphysical - i.e., the ontological, cosmological and physico-theological (or teleological) - proofs for God's existence. 1 In the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, Kant argues that our duties are not grounded in the divine will, but solely in the moral law (GMS IV:431). 2 Otherwise, morality would be based on religion, which would amount to theological morality and heteronomy. Hence, faith in God seems not to be necessary for a virtuous life and atheism seems to be compatible with morality within Kant's philosophy. Yet in many of his other works, including the Critique of Practical Reason, Critique of Judgment, Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason and his lesser known Lectures on the Philosophical Doctrine of Religion, Kant argues that 'morality leads inevitably to religion' (KPV V:125; RGV VI:6) and insists that faith in God is necessary for the intelligibility of the possibility of the highest good as the final end of the moral law. Furthermore, Kant condemns atheism on moral grounds arguing that - by rejecting the idea of God as a sufficient cause for the highest good - it rules out additional religious incentives for morality (KRV A 812/B 841), 3 leads to moral despair, weakens respect for the moral law, damages the moral disposition (KU V:540), and has a pernicious influence on society by causing social disorder (WDO VIII:146) and by robbing citizens of incentives for morality viewed as commanded and enforced by God (V-MS/Vigilantius XXVII:531). 4 This paper seeks to explore (1) Kant's moral criticism in the Critique of Judgment that atheism leads to moral despair by lacking the cognitively determinate and psychological reassuring view offered by rational faith for rendering the possibility of the highest good, i.e., the harmonious and proportionate union of virtue and happiness, intelligible, and (2) the rational, non-theistic alternatives that atheists may have recourse to which uphold the possibility of the highest good. Before tackling these issues, I offer a brief analysis of Kant's defence of moral theism and his conception of atheism.}},

  abstract     = {{Dual-fuel (DF) operation with methanol-diesel allows to reduce CO2 emissions, increase efficiency and decrease NOx and soot. This paper describes the experimental results with methanol-water (MeOH-W) blends as a fuel, and has three objectives: (1) whether water acts as a knock suppressant, enabling higher diesel substitution ratios, (2) if water can be a measure to control engine-out NOx emissions given its cooling effect, and (3) to test the effect on brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of a blend of 90% methanol and 10% water by weight, which is interesting from a methanol fuel production cost perspective. Experiments were conducted on a dual-fuel marine Volvo Penta engine with methanol/water weight by weight shares of 50%/50% (MeOH-50), 64%/36% (MeOH-64), 90%/10% (MeOH-90) and 100%/0% (pure methanol, MeOH-100). A maximal increase in BTE of 3.3% and 4.9% were observed when going from respectively MeOH-100 and diesel-only operation to MeOH-50. The maximum methanol energy fraction (MEF) was obtained with pure methanol, equal to 76%, and decreased with increasing water content. NOx emissions decreased with pure methanol compared to diesel-only operation, and further decreased with increasing water content. It is concluded that MeOH-90 does not harm the BTE of the tested dual-fuel engine; and that MeOH-50 and MeOH-64 were able to reach IMO Tier III NOx legislation, but at the same time score worse for greenhouse gas reduction potential as less diesel can be substituted by methanol with these blends. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd}},

Post feminism is a new form of empowerment, adjusted to the contemporary societal context. It focuses on agency, freedom, sexual pleasure, consumer culture, fashion, hybridism, humor, and a renewed focus on the female body. In popular media texts, the fiction series Sex and the City is often considered a signboard of post feminist discourse.
