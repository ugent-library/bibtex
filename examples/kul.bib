That is where the true success of depolarizing public debates on complex topics such as migration lies. The formulation and dissemination of depolarizing frames and counter–frames alone will not suffice. Nobody can force content creators (“translators from the real to the reel”) to use the proper frames and counter–frames if their professional habitat does not lend itself to that end. Only when policy makers start focusing on creating contexts that organically encourage these translators to use frames and counter–frames that nuance heated societal issues, will the depolarization of debates on controversial topics such as migration truly begin to happen.},

Weyer invita al espectador a tomar conciencia, a través de diferentes etapas de la adolescencia de Liliana y Elizabeth, de como ellas se ven obligadas a luchar tanto con la transición de la niñez a la edad adulta como con la expectativa cultural tácita de que para ascender en la escala socioeconómica americana deben dejar atrás sus raíces mexicanas.},

By considering discourse as one of the four basic factors of translation (next to contexts, agents, and practices), I draw on the parallels between the disciplines of translating and documentary making to perform a discourse analysis of documentaries centering on migration. More specifically, I rely on the concept of translation as a heuristic tool to distill the discourses that are embedded in documentaries on Latin American migration broadcast in the United States by the Public Broadcasting Service series POV between 1996 and 2018. My goal with such an interdisciplinary approach is not only to facilitate the holistic analysis of discourse in documentary film, but also to address the knowledge gap on positive discourses of migration.},

title = {Translating the Real to the Reel: The Representation of Latinx Migration in Documentaries},
year = {2021},
abstract = {The present doctoral study aims to chart the representation of Latinx migration to the US in documentary films. As US immigration policy grew increasingly restrictive over the course of the 20th century, public discourse became more antagonizing towards Latinx immigrants. Hence, there is a wealth of literature on stereotyping and antagonizing media frames of Latinxs. There is little information, however, on attempts by the media to approach social issues such as Latinx migration from a less prejudiced angle. The present study addresses this knowledge gap by focusing on documentary depictions of Latinx (im)migrants.
 
This study draws from Translation Studies to map out the route of real-life stories on Latinx migration to the documentary reel. By positing that documentaries and translations are prompted by the same oscillation between reality and representation to make authenticity claims, the study proposes to view documentaries as forms of translation. Such a stance allows for the documentary maker to take center stage and become a documentator: a documentarist-cum-translator with an agency to intervene in the transfer process from the real to the reel.
 
The corpus of this study consists of documentaries on Latinx migration to the US that were broadcast between 1988 and 2018 on the PBS series POV, the first and longest-running showcase of independent nonfiction films in the US. Looking at these documentaries as translations, the study zones in on their contexts, agents, discourses, and practices - four basic factors of translation. Defined in function of the study's aim to chart how independent documentary makers, as documentators, translate stories on Latinx migration from the real to the reel, "context" alludes to the properties of the target structure in which the transferred products were meant to circulate; "agents" are understood to be documentarists-cum-translators with an agency defined by their habitus; "discourses" stand for the documentators' ideological choices in their documentary target texts; and the "practices" are the concrete translation decisions that these agents made in the said texts.},

abstract = {A story about St. John Fox’s flailing marriage to Daphne Fox and purported adultery with Mary Foxe, Helen Oyeyemi’s 2011 novel Mr. Fox artfully remasters the age-old “Bluebeard” fairytale. Set in the U.S.A. of the 1930s, the mecca of hardboiled detective fiction during its Golden Age, Oyeyemi’s metafictional novel reads like a murder mystery. Both her readers and her characters are expected to decipher the hidden meanings behind Mr. Fox’s narrative foul play and, in doing so, they turn into detectives. Drawing on Heta Pyrhönen’s Bluebeard Gothic take on reader-detectives and criminal-authors and Peter Hühn’s association of reading and writing motifs with detective fiction, the present article puts the love triangle between author St. John, muse Mary, and wife Daphne under investigation. It is suggested that Oyeyemi’s ménage à trois can be interpreted as an anthropomorphic metaphor for the on-going power struggle between the patriarchal literary canon, established feminist literature, and up-and-coming woman writers, such as Black British author Helen Oyeyemi herself. With the writing of Mr. Fox, Oyeyemi appears to mirror the assertiveness and inquisitiveness of Bluebeard’s last wife, whose disobedient questioning of Bluebeard’s canonical authority leads her to discover, denounce, and warn other women about his murderous nature.},

abstract = {In this article, I argue that Hannah Weyer's documentaries La boda (2000) and Escuela (2002) use the metaphor of teen angst to explore how receiving countries tend to equate the process of successful immigration with that of reaching adulthood. With her unobtrusive camera work, Weyer invites the viewer to become aware of the disturbing parallel between the coming-of-age of the Luis sisters and the assimilation process imposed on them, as second-generation immigrants in the US. Navigating through different stages of adolescence, Liliana and Elizabeth struggle as much with the transition from children to grown-ups as they do with the unspoken cultural expectation that in order to climb the socio-economic ladder they are to leave their Mexican roots behind. Real-life examples of the “immigrant paradox”, “the second generation revolt” or “the second generation decline”, the sisters do not seem to continue the “straight-line assimilation” that was initiated by their parents. Based on the zealous assumption that each generation that issues from immigration will go through a gradually smoother incorporation into mainstream society, the straight-line assimilation theory predicts upward mobility for each generation in matters of education and employment thanks to increasing residential concentration and intermarriage patterns, and decreasing ethnic distinctiveness in language use. However, as Elizabeth and Liliana go through financial, legal, and educational turmoil, they do not simply poke holes in this overly enthusiastic theory. They demonstrate that with the way the American schooling and social security systems are currently designed, their demographic was always set up to fail anyway.},

abstract = {The present article discusses the nature of ethnic detective fiction from
the comparative perspective of world literature by underscoring the divergent discourses that can hide under such a seemingly unified subgenre. In the context of our current understanding of world literature, both the Inspector Ramirez series by Canadian crime writer Peggy Blair and the Lieutenant Conde series by Cuban author Leonardo Padura can be categorized as multiethnic, international, minority,
multicultural, cross-cultural or ethnic detective fiction, because of the series’
focus on the Cuban crime scene. However, a comparison of the action-space, plotspace, and worldview chronotopes (i.e. time-space frames) of The Beggar’s Opera and Pasado perfecto reveals that the focalizers of both novels adhere to opposite worldviews. Pasado perfecto’s Cuban worldview chronotope largely conforms to the premises of the original hardboiled paradigm, whereas the Canadian worldview of The Beggar’s Opera appears to cross over from detective fiction into ethnographic travel fiction. In the end, it would seem the only thing holding both
novels together is their shared label of ethnic detective fiction.},

title = {When Chronic Uncertainty Makes for Uncertain Chronicles: A Case Study on PBS Independent Documentaries and their Storytelling on Latinx Migration to the US},
year = {2020},
abstract = {In the United States, public service broadcasting has been chronically plagued by “financial insecurity, political intimidation, and corporate seduction” (Starr, 2002, p. 44). In comparison to elsewhere, public broadcasting been a marginal phenomenon in the United States because proponents in other nations were able to establish their systems before commercial broadcasters had achieved dominance over the airwaves (McChesney, 2004, pp. 243–244). From its early beginnings, public service broadcasting in the US has had to depend on meager federal funding, on the one hand, and unpredictable donations from subscribers and underwriters, on the other. The uncertainty that has come to characterize public media reached its peak when the US Telecommunications Act of 1996 allowed for the deregulation of the telecommunications market. The Act essentially equated the public interest with the public’s interest and purported that increasing the number of television channels by eliminating the limits on the number of broadcasting stations any one corporation could own would increase the diversity of offerings (cf. Fowler \& Brenner, 1981, pp. 3–4). In reality, the Act forced public broadcasting to become more commercialized in order to be able to compete with the ever-expanding commercial television market (Cook, 2016, p. 93). From that point on, public television executives had no other choice but to reinvent PBS as a brand (cf. Mccauley et al., 2016; Perlman, 2016). Their branding strategy was to “turn the cultural value of the old PBS into financial value for the new PBS” (Hoynes, 2016, p. 50). The public service that used to be a given in public broadcasting—namely to serve as a forum for debate and controversy, to provide a voice for groups that may otherwise be unheard, and to show America in all its diversity (Carnegie Commission on Educational Television, 1967)—was now “increasingly being packaged and sold to consumers who [were] brand-loyal to PBS” (Hoynes, 2016, p. 46). In this paper, I ponder the consequences of this chronic uncertainty on the programming of Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). More specifically, I focus on the PBS series POV, the longest-running showcase of independent documentaries on American television, and its chronicling of LatinX migration to the US (1988-2018). Since deregulation coincided with what Henry Jenkins calls “convergence culture,” i.e. an environment “where old and new media collide, where grassroots and corporate media intersect, where the power of the media producer and the power of the media consumer interact in unpredictable ways” (Jenkins, 2006, p. 2), I argue that PBS fed into this combination of deregulation and convergence to make itself more marketable. Through programs such as POV, PBS began bringing “perspectives that are considered ‘outside the mainstream’” (Poon, 2016, p. 135) in order to offer programming that complimented their already established reputation of “town hall of the air” with convergent grassroots content, seemingly plucked right off the street (Starr, 2016, p. 239). Finally, I suggest that this perceived need to cater to the non-mainstream translates to the kind of stories POV selects on a topic such as LatinX migration: contrapuntal narratives that reflect and converge with PBS’s own myth of the self, namely that of the uncertain underdog being mercilessly tormented by menacing, but ultimately fallible Goliaths.},

abstract = {When sculptor John Houser obtains funding from the El Paso City Council in the late eighties to complete an equestrian statue of the controversial conqueror Juan de Oñate, a Native American deluge of anger and hurt pours over the city of El Paso, Texas. Meant to celebrate the Spanish involvement in the founding of the Texan city of El Paso and the New Mexican cities of Santa Fe and Las Cruces, the statue comes under fire when the Acoma Pueblo Native Americans inform the City Council of the cruel treatment their community suffered at the hands of the last conquistador to have ruled over present-day US territories. The documentary The Last Conquistador (Valadez and Ibarra 2008) follows the pro-Oñate activists of the New Mexican Hispanic Culture Preservation League (NMHCPL), the Acoma, John Houser, and the City Council over the course of about 10 years, capturing the feud from different angles. Basing ourselves on Foucault’s notion of heterotopia (2008 [1967]), Soja’s spatial trialectics (1996, 2000), and Bakhtin’s heteroglossia (Bakhtin 1983; Tjupa 2013), we argue that The Last Conquistador depicts the decaying city of El Paso as a heteroglossic and heterotopic Thirdspace: a paradoxical in-between where several sociocultural paradigms coexist and overlap thanks to the continual collision of distinct, and often completely opposite, voices and points-of-view. The article concludes with a metadiscursive reflection on The Last Conquistador and its status of independent documentary. Considering The Last Conquistador was a co-presentation between Latino Public Broadcasting, Vision Maker Media (formerly Native American Public Telecommunications), and the North Texan public television station KERA, we suggest the documentary’s chronicling of El Paso’s misguided use of public funds can be read as a metaphor for the insecurities plaguing the field of public service broadcasting at large.},

abstract = {The present paper ponders the epistemological foundations of public service broadcasting and its documentary tradition. If public television were to be seen as a memory institution, could the items it broadcasts on a particular topic be equated with televised cultural transfers? Using the independent documentaries on LatinX migration to the US aired over the last 30 years by the series POV on PBS (Public Broadcasting Service) as a case study, I argue that all 21 of these documentaries can be seen as mediated transfers between LatinX sources and US targets. Drawing on the traveling concepts of assumed translation and assumed transfer, I propose an epistemological reconceptualization of the documentaries of my corpus. I suggest that an approach inspired by the notion of cultural transfer might open up new avenues of research and reflection, both within my corpus and the field of documentary and television studies at large.},

year = {2018},
abstract = {The PBS documentary The Last Conquistador (2008) records the anger and hurt that arises in El Paso, Texas when the City Council commissions an equestrian statue of Spanish conquistador Juan de Oñate (1550–1626). Meant as a gesture of acknowledgment and celebration of the centuries-old Hispanic presence in (what is known today as) the USA, the statue comes under fire when the Acoma Pueblo of El Paso inform the City Council of the cruel treatment their community suffered at the hands of the so-called Last Conquistador. What starts as a heated debate between the New Mexico Hispanic Culture Preservation League and the Acoma quickly escalates into a protracted war of words, mediated by the El Paso City Council as well as John Houser, the sculptor of the contested statue. More than an observational portrayal of a seemingly unsurmountable dilemma, The Last Conquistador rather resembles a triptych: a tripartite piece that cannot hide the hinges with which it is forcefully held together and which, ultimately, betray its illusion of unity. By that logic, I argue that The Last Conquistador’s treatment of El Paso as a symbolically fragmented border town categorizes it as one of Foucault’s heterotopias, “counter-emplacements […] in which the real emplacements […] that can be found within culture, are simultaneously represented, contested and inverted; a kind of places that are outside all places, even though they are actually localizable” (2008 [1967]: 17). Surprisingly, when confronted with Bakhtinian heteroglossia, i.e. the coming together of competing ideological points of view (cf. Blackledge and Creese 2014), heterotopic El Paso seems to be caught off guard and, unbeknownst to itself, proves to be more apt to stifle dialogue than to encourage it. Inspired by Soja’s thirdspace (1996) and de Certeau's notion of spatial practices of every-day life (2007 [1980]), this paper also reflects on the metafictional dimensions of the trialectics of spatiality (Lefebvre 1991) established by The Last Conquistador and draws parallels between the thematic content of the documentary and its status as a PBS co-presentation with Latino Public Broadcasting and Native American Public Telecommunications.},

year = {2018},
abstract = {En el artículo influyente “Frontera regional en Brasil. El entre-lugar de la identidad y de los territorios baianeros en Minas Gerais” (2003) el antropólogo brasileño Joao Batista de Almeida Costa juntó el concepto de la frontera como espacio físico de Edward Soja y como lugar de identificación liminar de Homi Bhabha bajo una sola cubierta mediante la denominación entre-lugar. Podría afirmarse que para los indígenas de las Minas Gerais tanto como para la diáspora latinoamericana de los Estados Unidos, el entre-lugar no es un concepto abstracto, sino un modo de vivir y una manera de ser. Sin embargo, la política de inmigración estadounidense siempre ha preferido la idea anglosajona del melting pot o crisol cultural donde cada recién llegado se homogeneiza en el lecho de mezcla al ideal ortizano del ajiaco transcultural que permite que cada elemento mantenga su sabor original. Desde la creación del Latino Public Broadcasting Project en 1998-1999, la llamada comunidad latina de los EE.UU. ha podido desahogarse y hacerse cargo de su propia definición sociocultural. El LPBP es una organización sin ánimo de lucro que opera en sincronismo con los otros National Minority Consortia financiados por la Corporation for Public Broadcasting con el objetivo de producir y adquirir medios de comunicación educativa y cultural que traten de cuestiones de interés especial para la comunidad latina. Esta ponencia investiga las razones por las cuales el género preferido del LPBP es el documental. De hecho, en los documentales del LPBP las encrucijadas psicológicas y materiales que caracterizan a la comunidad fronteriza latina no parecen servir únicamente de foro social, sino también de plataforma para la mediación de las tensiones que nacen en el in-between y que, de cierta forma, lo perpetúan (cf. Soja). Por ende, se sugiere que la fuerza de este género se encuentra presumiblemente en su capacidad –quizás ilusoria– de dialogar con las relaciones de poder, a diferencia de la ambición de los medios corporativos de abrazarlas.},

title = {On the Poetics and Politics of the So-Called Ethnic Detective Novel},
year = {2015},
abstract = {In the very wide and diversified field of “murder fiction” (Rzepka 2005: 1), it would seem a relatively new and, therefore, polynomial and vague subgenre has slowly been taking shape, namely that of the “ethno-detective novels” (Erdmann 2009: 11) – also known as “multiethnic crime fiction” (Fisher-Hornung \& Mueller 2003);“international crime fiction” (Krajenbrink \& Quinn 2009); “‘minority’, ‘multicultural’,‘cross-cultural’ and ‘postcolonial’” or “‘ethnic’ detective fiction” (Matzke \& Mühleisen 2006: 6-7). The burning question on the lips of the literary critic or scholar discussing this emerging genre is, as Matzke and Mühleisen so succinctly state, whether “practitioners of ‘ethnic’ detective fiction need to be ‘ethnic’ themselves in order to be ‘truly’ representative” (2006: 7). The answer to this question is conspicuous by its absence. Very few dare to enter such a debate as it often leads to politically and ethically sensitive issues, where there is a risk of essentializing categories of voice and experience by naturalizing non-mainstream voices or non-mainstream experiences and by ignoring the complex forces that produce them (Bergland 1994: 132). Nevertheless, in this paper I attempt to enter into that dreaded discussion by looking beyond the categories of ‘voice’ versus ‘experience’. Relying on Bart Keunen’s interpretation of the Bakhtinian chronotope, I compare two ethnic detective novels, where one is written by what Fischer-Hornung and Mueller refer to as a “cultural [outsider]” – The Beggar’s Opera (2012) by Canadian Peggy Blair – and the other is written “from an insider’s perspective” – Pasado perfecto (2000) by Cuban Leonardo Padura (2003: 13).},

year = {2015},
abstract = {Goethe, the founding father of Weltliteratur as we know it today, first started lobbying for a unified world literature to counteract the destabilizing fragmentation underlying most of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century - a fragmentation to which we can relate today and which, probably, best explains our renewed interest in the concept of world literature. Weltliteratur was to be a vehicle for the worldwide spread of humanist ideals and values and Goethe's language of choice, which would act as a sort of arbiter for the dissemination of work in foreign languages throughout Europe, was his own native German.

Fast-forwarding a century or two, the Eurocentric undertones of Goethe's well-intended enterprise have barely changed or shifted. The main difference is that with the U.S.A. as the world's only superpower it is English and not German that has become the lingua franca of world literature.

In this paper, I discuss a case study on two ethnic detective novels set in Cuba where one originates from a cultural outsider The Beggar's Opera (2012) by Canadian Peggy Blair â and the other is written from an insider's perspective Pasado perfecto (2001) by Cuban Leonardo Padura â in order to argue that the above-mentioned essentializing "Anglophony" is inextricably intertwined with the current understanding of world literature. The consequence hereof is a perpetuation of the old notions of centers and margins that the new comparative literature model is supposedly countering.},

However, I argue in this paper that Mr. Fox is consistent with Oyeyemi’s previous work, both in theme and in genre. On the one hand, I observe that, even though the subject of gender is what drives the plot of Mr. Fox, the subject of race is, still, touched upon by Oyeyemi on several occasions, namely in the short-stories the main characters of Mr. Fox tell each other. On the other, I suggest that Mr. Fox, just as Oyeyemi’s other three novels, can be tied in with the Gothic genre. Basing myself on Heta Pyrhönen’s recently published Bluebeard Gothic: Jane Eyre and its Progeny (2010), I offer a new reading of Mr. Fox, namely as a rewriting of, both, the Bluebeard tale cycle and Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre (1847). Considering that ‘Bluebeard,’ Jane Eyre and, consequently, Mr. Fox can be interpreted as a power struggle between Man as a “criminal-author, writing his stories in his secret chamber” and Woman as “a detective-reader, whose reading enables her to write her way out of Bluebeard’s deadly plot,” and taking into account that Oyeyemi denounces, both, gender and race issues in this novel, I conclude that Mr. Fox might perhaps be her most politically charged and accusatory work to date, despite its, seemingly, light-hearted fairy tale themes and motifs (Hermansson in Pyrhönen 2010: 18).},
